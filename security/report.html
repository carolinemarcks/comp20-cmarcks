<a name ="introduction"></a><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>ScoreCenter is a resource to hold the scores for a number of online games.  It has capabilities for sorting by game and by user, in some instances sorting by score (high to low). This online resource removes the burden of server side development from the game developers.</p>
<p>In the gaming community, high score is a major point of pride. The security of ScoreCenter, therefore, is paramount to it's usability by web games. We have been hired to examine ScoreCenter on the subject of security, and present our findings and recommendations here.</p>

<a name ="methodology"></a><h1>Methodology</h1>
<p> To inspect the product, the source code was supplied by Jacob Lipson, which was run locally.  Most of the issues were found with a basic code review.  Simple command line tools (eg curl) were also used to post custom data to the webpage.

<a name ="abstract"></a><h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>The issues fall into two main categories. The first is verification.  There is no verification of user or game identity.  This means that anyone can send the website data containing a username that is not their own, or with a game title that they have not actually played (and therefore do not deserve to be listed in the scores for).  The second issue lies in input validation.  Attackers can change the page to present inaccurate data or bombard users with popups and redirects if they so choose.
<a name ="issues"></a><h1>Issues</h1>
<ol>
<li>No Field Input Validation
  <ul>
    <li>Location: "/submit.json", "/", and potentially "/showuserscores"</li>
    <li>Severity of issue: High</li>
    <li>Description: in submit.json, the bodies of "game_title", "username", or other fields can have javascript injected into them.  This javascript will then execute on any page it is rendered on, like the homepage or search result pages.  Examples of such scripts are alert boxes and redirects, making the site unusable for other users.  These could be inserted by posting 
        <div class = code>{"game_title":"frogger","username":"&ltscript&gt alert(\"HELLO\");&lt /script &gt ","score":"87"}</div>
        or
        <div class = code>{"game_title":"&ltscript&gt window.location = \"http://www.google.com/\";&lt/script&gt","username":"batman","score":"87"}
        </div>
        The attacker could also use the script to change the content of the page as it renders and change all of the apparent scores, also rendering the page useless.
    </li>
    <li>Resolution: encode all input with the escape() function before rendering it on the page</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>No Verification of Submitter Identity
  <ul>
    <li>Location: "/submit.json" </li>
    <li>Severity of issue: Medium </li>
    <li>Description: allows jsons to be submitted by any source, whether or not it actually be a gaming website.
    </li>
    <li>Resolution: modify the "res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");" line in the source code to only accept from verified game sources</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>No User Verification
  <ul>
    <li>Location: "/submit.json" </li>
    <li>Severity of issue: Medium</li>
    <li>Description: Anyone can submit data to ScoreCenter with any username.  As such, any game player can enter a username without verifying it is not associated with another user, therefore clogging the scores for certain names. </li>
    <li>Resolution: require user registration (ie creating a password) and require the user to submit that password before their score is recorded in ScoreCenter.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ol>

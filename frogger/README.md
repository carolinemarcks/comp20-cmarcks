========================
Caroline Marcks
---------------

To my knowledge, all main aspects of this assignment have been implemented correctly.
I have also incorporated level progression, time and other scoring features (including
a randomly appearing fly), as well as alligators, snakes, and turtles.

I have not collaborated or discussed the assignment with anyone.

I have spent approximately 12 hours on this assignment.
